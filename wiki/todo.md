# TODO
## Shortcuts
* Add a checkbox using `ctrl-<Space>`
* Use `gl<Space>` to remove checkbox
* Toggle an item complete use `ctrl-<Space>` with your cursor on the line you want to toggle. 
* Todo lists also work for nested items, simply indent the item. Vim folding works with nested lists. Toggling will also mark all sub-items.
* For an item that might be partially complete, use `gln` to toggle forward completion levels, and use `glp` to toggle backwards completion levels. 
* See `:help vimwiki-todo`
